### Raiden Hasegawa



### Method in a nutshell.

We use an Item Response Theory parameterization with a discrete representation
of latent ability.  This allows us to estimate our data model as a finite
mixture of Bernoulli random variables and maximize the log-posterior using the
Expectation Component Maximization (ECM) algorithm.  We opt for a semi-Bayesian
treatment and introduce priors to what would normally be a maximum likelihood
problem due to issues with non-uniqueness of the likelihood maximization problem
and numerical difficulties arising from large parameter estimates.



The Problem.
------------

We are given a dataset consisting of ~14,000 astronometrics students with their
performance on multiple choice test questions selected from a set of 400 in some
fashion, presumably randomly.  Tasked with teaching this year's astronometrics
class of a similar size with only a few TAs, we decide to construct our final
exam by selecting five questions randomly from the pre-approved question bank
for each student with hopes of realizing a meaningful ranking of the students at
the end of the class.  The problem here is that we know that some of the
questions are not very good at actually testing the astronometric knowledge of
our students.  We want to eliminate these questions from our question bank, but
the school requires us to use at least half of the questions in our test
generation algorithm so as to cover the full range of topics.  If we knew which
questions were good, we could easily eliminate these. But, unfortunately
question quality is unobserved.  Additionally, since we don't know what
questions are good questions, the scores of last years students are at best a
noisy measure of the students' ability.  Knowing neither of these exactly makes
this a challenging problem.



Hypothesis.
-----------

The first thing we must do is define what a good question is.  Since we are
looking for questions that can help us determine a meaningful ranking of
student's knowledge of astronometrics at the end of the course, we can make the
reasonable assumption that a good question is one that is good at distinguishing
between students of different levels of understanding.  How can we identify this
quality of the questions in our question bank given our dataset?



### A first guess.

One heuristic measure of a good question, as defined above, is the log-odds
ratio of answering the question correctly between students with different levels
of understanding.  Consider students $j$ and $k$ and question $i$.  The log-odds
ratio of question $i$ between the two students can be written mathematically as

$$
logOdds^i_{j,k} = \log{\left(\frac{\frac{P_j(Correct_i)}{P_j(Incorrect_i)}}{\frac{P_k(Correct_i)}{P_k(Incorrect_i)}\right)}
$$

In particular, a good questions should have a high log-odds ratio between
students with a high level of understanding (student $j$) and those with a low
understanding (student $k$).  This just means that when answering a good
astronometrics question, it is more likely that students who know more
astonometrics will answer the question correctly.  If the log-odds ratio is near
or less than zero, the question is probably not a good gauge of astronometric
knowledge.



### Empirical log-odds.

Before performing more sophisticated analyses, we can get a sense of what the
log-odds ratio tells us about our dataset.  Consider a world where there are
only two types of students: good students and bad students.  A simple rule to
partition the students in our dataset into these two groups is to label the top
50% of the students in terms of empirical probability of answering a question
correctly as good students and the bottom 50% as bad students.  We can then look
at each question and compare the probability of answering it correctly for both
groups.  The empirical probability that student $n$ in our dataset answers
question $i$ correctly can be written as

$$
\hat{P}_{i,k} = \frac{1}{|D_n|}\sum_{i \in D_n} \mathbb{I}_{n,i}
$$

where $\mathbb{I}_{n,i}$ takes the value 1 if student $n$ answers $i$ correctly
and 0 otherwise and $D_n$ is the set of questions that we have data for on
student $n$.  Below is a plot of each question in our dataset where the x-axis
is the empirical probability that a bad student (as defined by our rule) will
get the question correct and the y-axis is the empirical probability that a good
student will get the question correct.  The red dotted lines are log-odds
iso-contours starting at a log-odds ratio of 0 on the 45 degree line and going
up in increments of $\frac{1}{2}$ toward the northwest corner.

![](<https://github.com/raibread/knewton-ml-challenge/blob/master/figures/logOddsContour.pdf>)

The data exhibits a pretty nice pattern with most questions falling between the
1.5 and 2.5 log-odds ratio contours.  The striking feature of this chart is the
outlying questions that have log-odds ratios of less than 1.5 (there are even
some below zero!).  You can see this even more clearly by rank ordering the
log-odds ratio for each question and noticing the dramatic drop off at the left
tail (see below).

![](<https://github.com/raibread/knewton-ml-challenge/blob/master/figures/logOdds.pdf>)

If I was the professor of this year's class and I had very little time to figure
out which questions to eliminate I might use the log-odds ratio heuristic and
drop a number of these outlying questions from our test generation algorithm.
This method has a few very obvious drawbacks.  First, we are pretty certain that
the quality of a student can't be represented sufficiently by our good/bad
binary model of ability.  Second, even if the world did follow our model, since
each student only answers a randomly sampled subset of our questions, our rule
for figuring out which student belongs to which type is potentially very noisy.
In the same vain, some questions are not attempted by many students at all so
our log-odds ratio measure may also be very noisy.  This may not be a great
algorithm in practice but it does help us clarify what we are looking for:
questions that can reliably discriminate between students of different ability.

Motivation.
-----------

The purely graphical analysis above can actually be motivated by some useful and
well studied theory: Item Response Theory (IRT).  Briefly (since I am sure you
know more about this than me), the two parameter logistic IRT model
parameterizes the probability that a student $n$ with some latent (unobserved)
ability $\theta_k$ answers question $i$, which can be characterized by its
difficulty $\alpha_i$ and its discrimination $\delta_i$, as

$$
P(X_i=1 | \theta_k,\delta_i,\alpha_i) = p_{ki} = \frac{e^{\delta_i(\theta_k-\alpha_i)}}{1 + e^{\delta_i(\theta_k-\alpha_i)}}
$$

where $X_{ni}$ is a random variable that takes value 1 when student $n$ gets
question $i$ correct and 0 otherwise.  With this parameterization in mind, one
can see that the log-odds ratio for each question $i$ we looked at in the
previous section can be written as

$$
logOdds^i_{good,bad} = \delta_i(\theta_{good}-\theta_{bad}) \propto \delta_i\,.
$$

The discrimination parameter is directly related to our idea of log-odds.
Graphically, it corresponds to the slope of the logit function.  With this model
in tow, we might be able to do a better job than our graphical analysis above.

Method.
-------

To make the analysis simpler, we assume that latent ability can be modelled as a
discrete variable that we know ahead of time (this is an obvious weakness of the
model).  Although this assumption might not be optimal, it may be detailed
enough to assign students to the right letter grade (we use 8 latent classesâ€¦ I
guess we should have used 11 or 12 to map to an A-F scale).  We predetermine
that $\theta_k$ can take values -2, -1.5, -1,-.5, .5, 1,  1.5 or 2.
Additionally, we assume that items are independent in the sense that,
conditional on latent ability $\theta_k$, responses to any two items are
independent.  The goal is to estimate $\delta_i$ and $\alpha_i$ for each
question.  In particular, we want estimates of the $\delta_i$'s in order to rank
the questions in our question bank based on how well they discern the ability of
a student.  To do this, we maximize a log-posterior distribution of the
parameters given the data $X_{ni}$ using the Expectation Component Maximization
(ECM) algorithm.

Originally, I wanted to put the model in a maximum likelihood framework but
because of questions in our dataset with only a few student observations, there
are some issues with large parameter estimates that caused numerical overflow
(i.e. $e^{\delta_i(\theta_k-\alpha_i)}$ was too big).  Another issue is that the
maximum likelihood is not unique since $\delta_i(\theta_k-\alpha_i)=C$ for any
constant $C$ yields solution curves rather than a unique solution for $\delta_i$
and $\alpha_i$.  Thus, we introduce normal priors on $\delta_i$ and $\alpha_i$.
The mean and standard deviations of the priors were chosen somewhat arbitrarily
(another weakness) but we have some reasoning for the choices.  We choose a
larger standard deviation ($s.d.= 2$) for the $\delta_i's$.  Since we are most
interested in their ranking, we want to allow them to vary enough to generate a
useful ranking.  We keep the prior on the $\alpha_i$'s smaller ($s.d. = 1)$ so
our algorithm (hopefully) converges to a unique solution.  The means of the
priors on $\delta_i$ and $\alpha_i$ are 1 and 0, respectively.  These means
reduce our 2 parameter model to a model that explains the observed data as a
function only of student ability and thus seem like reasonable choices.

Because we are using a discrete representation of latent ability, we can express
our log-likelihood as a mixture of Bernoulli random variables which lends itself
to the use of the EM algorithm to maximize the log-posterior (see Bishop,
2006.).  The latent variables in this model, $Z = \{z_1,z_2,\cdots,z_n\}\in
\mathbb{R}^K$, are unit vectors of length $K$ (the number of latent ability
classes) with one element equal to one and all other elements equal to zero. The
latent variables assign each student to a latent ability.  For the Bernoulli
mixtures model, the E-step of the EM algorithm calculates the expectation of the
latent variables, $z_{nk} \forall n\le N,k\le K$, conditional on the data.  The
M-step then maximizes the expectation of the complete data ($X,Z$ - observed and
latent) log-posterior with respect to $Z$ (see the appendix for mathematical
details).  Since our parameter space is so large, we split our maximization step
into two components: with respect to $\alpha$ and with respect to $\delta$.  The
parameter space is still large in both cases but because local independence is
assumed our hessians for both components end up being diagonal which is
computationally friendly (See Meng & Rubin, 1993. for why ECM works).  The
mathematical appendix gives the formulae for the log-posterior, expected log
posterior, gradients, hessians, etc.

Once we estimate our model, we can identify the questions with the smallest
$\delta_i$'s and eliminate them from the question bank.  A reasonable cutoff for
inclusion in the question bank may be $\delta_i>1$.  In addition to discovering
and eliminating bad questions, this estimation will allow us to assign students
in this upcoming year to latent ability classes (grades) based on the new
parameter estimates post-exam (we can't determine exactly which grade a student
deserves (their $z_n$) but can determine which latent ability most likely
explains the result of their test).

Results.
--------

The list of questions removed by the algorithm can be found in
'results/emMartianRemove2013_03_18_15_06_32.txt'. Our ECM algorithm ran for 110
iterations until the max parameter change for any $\delta_i$ was less than 1e-5.
But, upon viewing the evolution of the $\delta_i$ it is clear that convergence
to a useful ordering happens much earlier on.  Except for $\delta_i$ very close
to our inclusion cut-off of 1, we know which questions we will eliminate well
before the 110th iteration.  You can see this in the plot below which show the
parameter evolution of 50 random $\delta_i$ over the first 50 iterations.

![](<https://github.com/raibread/knewton-ml-challenge/blob/master/figures/deltas_evol.pdf>)

A look at the histogram of estimated $\delta_i$ show that many of the
$\delta_i<1$ present themselves as outliers with respect to the rest of the
distribution which suggests that our criterion for inclusion isn't unreasonable.
The only thing that we need to check is that our cutoff criterion doesn't shrink
our question bank to less than $\frac{1}{2}$ its original size (it doesn't).

![](<https://github.com/raibread/knewton-ml-challenge/blob/master/figures/deltas_hist.pdf>)

Plotting the rank-ordered $\delta_i$ gives rise to a figure that is similar to
the rank-ordering we saw in our initial exploratory analysis where the questions
tail off dramatically in there ability to discern the ability of a student at a
certain point.

![](<https://github.com/raibread/knewton-ml-challenge/blob/master/figures/deltas_rankOrder.pdf>)

Notice in the rank-ordering though, that the majority of $\delta_i$ span a
narrow range of values.  We don't extract a posterior measure of variance for
each parameter since we are essentially just mode-finding.  Thus, we should be
careful about the certainty with which me make statements about the quality of
questions.  Given the time constraints, this method probably yields a pretty
good estimate, but a MCMC method may be a better option since you can sample the
whole posterior distribution with this method and generate estimates for the
variance of our estimated parameters.  We could loosen our priors to see if we
get our $\delta_i$'s to span a larger wider range, but this most likely will
have the effect of increasing the posterior variance which leaves us dealing
with the same issue.  It might be wise to only eliminate the questions in the
lower tail (see the $\delta_i$ rank order plot) from the question bank rather
than using our $\delta_i<1$ cutoff rule.

This issue aside, let's see if our ECM results are in line with our initial
exploratory analysis.  Below is the same log-odds contour plot we saw earlier
with the questions that our ECM determined as having $\delta_i<1$ marked with
yellow dots.  Our algorithm appears to eliminate the questions that reside in
the lower log-odds contour areas which is what we had expected.

![](<https://github.com/raibread/knewton-ml-challenge/blob/master/figures/logOddsContour_post.pdf>)

This is intuitively satisfying but makes one wonder if our heuristic approach
would have been enough?  My guess would be that the answer is no.  There's a lot
of subjectivity in this approach and using the IRT framework and estimating our
model can provide useful theoretical motivation for our inclusion rule.
Introducing a more explicit modeling and estimation framework can help us infer
more information about our students and compare students abilities.  You can
also see from the plot that we have a finer understanding of how to
differentiate questions: sone excluded questions are very close in proximity to
included questions. Using the heuristic approach may yield a similar set of
questions for our question bank but gives us a systematic way to assign students
into ability classes (i.e. grades) by comparing the estimated likelihood a
student answers the questions the way they did given they are in a particular
latent ability class (see appendix for derivation of this term, $\gamma_{nk} =
E[z_{nk}]$).

Other Remarks.
--------------

-   Local independence could be a pretty unreasonable assumption since several
    questions may address different but related (or not even different) concepts
    in astronometrics. Scientific discovery and knowledge builds upon itself so
    it would be difficult to believe that one could construct a set of ~400
    questions that are collectively exhaustive (in terms of material covered)
    but mutually exclusive.

-   In hindsight, it may have made sense to eliminate questions from our dataset
    that had very few student attempts.  This may have allowed us to avoid using
    restrictive priors, although the issue of non-uniqueness may still have been
    an issue.

-   We could have also split the M-step into a component for each item given the
    assumption of local independence.  The hessians would no longer be diagonal
    since $\delta_i$ and $\alpha_i$ are correlated, but each hessian would only
    be $2\times 2$ and thus easily invertible (unless singularâ€¦).  The upside is
    that we might get faster convergence since we can explicitly take into
    account this correlation.  The downside is that the convergence speed up
    might be negated by increased computation (just a guess).

-   With more time, it would be good to study the sensitivity of our results to
    changes in the the specification to $\theta_k$ (both to the number of
    ability classes and the $\theta$ value of each class) as well as to our
    choice of priors.  An even more useful next step may be to estimate the
    $\theta_k$ values as well in the maximization step, but this introduces
    another level of indeterminacy (i.e. $(\theta_k+c) - \alpha_i = \theta_k -
    (\alpha_i-c)$) which we would have to deal with with another prior, which
    although less subjective than choosing the $\theta_k$ values explicitly, is
    still a subjective decision.

Appendix.
---------



All formulae are for items $i$, students $n$ and latent abilities $k$. These
derivations draw from Bishop, 2006. pretty heavily.



### Priors

$$
\alpha_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)\; i.i.d.,\, \forall i
$$

$$
\delta_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0,2)\; i.i.d.,\, \forall i
$$



### Probability a student in ability class k answers question i correctly

This is the two parameter IRT model.

$$
\p_{ki} = \frac{e^{\delta_i(\theta_k-\alpha_i)}}{1 + e^{\delta_i(\theta_k-\alpha_i)}}
$$



Derivatives (useful for gradient and hessian derivation):

w.r.t. $\alpha_i$:

$$
\frac{\partial p_ki}{\delta \alpha_i} = -\delta_i p_{ki}(1-p_{ki})
$$

w.r.t. $\delta_i$

$$
\frac{\partial p_ki}{\delta \delta_i} = (\theta_k-\alpha_i) p_{ki}(1-p_{ki})
$$



### Student level likelihood

The probability that student $n$ receives the scores that we observed $(x_n =
\{x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_n\}$) given that they are in ability class $k$.



$$
P(x_n | \theta_k, \alpha, \delta) = \prod_{i\in D_n} p_{ki}^{x_{ni}}(1-p_{ki})^{(1-x_{ni})}
$$



### Posterior probability that ability class k is "responsible" for student n's results

This is the expectation of $z_{nk}$, which is equivalent to the probability
(likelihood) that the student $n$ gets the scores we observed $(x_n =
\{x_1,x_2,\codts,x_n\}$) given being in latent ability class $k$.  This is
evaluated

$$
\gamma_{nk} = E[z_{nk}] = \frac{\pi_k P(x_n | \theta_k, \alpha, \delta)}{\sum_{k=1}^K \pi_k P(x_n | \theta_k, \alpha, \delta)}
$$

### Unconditional probability of being in a particular latent ability class

This result is derived by maximizing the Lagrangian of the log-posterior with
the condition that these probabilities, $\pi_k$'s, add up to one.

$$
\pi_k = \frac{\sum_{n=1}^N \gamma_{nk}}{N}
$$

### Log-posterior

This is what we are maximizing using the ECM algorithm (the second and third
terms are due to the priors on $\alpha$ and $\delta$)

$$
\mathcal{P}(\delta,\alpha | \theta,\pi,X) \propto \sum_{n=1}^N \log\left\{ \sum_{k=1}^K \pi_k P(x_n | \theta_k, \alpha, \delta) \right\} - \sum_{i=1}^D \frac{\alpha_i^2}{2} - \sum_{i=1}^D \frac{(\delta_i-1)^2}{8}
$$

### Expectation of complete-data log-posterior w.r.t Z

This is what we explicitly maximize in the CM-step.  Complete data means both
the students results, $X_{ni},\, \forall n,i$ and the latent $Z_n$ vectors.

$$
E_Z[\mathcal{P}(\delta,\alpha | \theta,\pi,X)] \propto \sum_{n=1}^N\sum_{k=1}^K \gamma_{nk} \left\{\log{\pi_k} + \sum_{i \in D_n} x_{ni}\log{p_{ki}} + (1-x_{ni})\log{(1-p_{ki})} \right\} - \sum_{i=1}^D \frac{\alpha_i^2}{2} - \sum_{i=1}^D \frac{(\delta_i-1)^2}{8}
$$

### Gradients

Of the expectation the complete-data log-posterior w.r.t. Z.

w.r.t. $\alpha_i$:

$$
\frac{\partial E_z}{\partial \alpha_i} = \sum_{n=1}^N\sum_{k=1}^K \gamma_{nk} \left\{ -\delta_i(x_{ni} - p_{ki}) \right\} - \alpha_i
$$

w.r.t. $\delta_i$:

$$
\frac{\partial E_z}{\partial \delta_i} = \sum_{n=1}^N\sum_{k=1}^K \gamma_{nk} \left\{(\theta_k - \alpha_i)(x_{ni} - p_{ki}) \right\} - \frac{(\delta_i-1)}{4}
$$

### Hessians

Of the expectation of the complete-data log-posterior w.r.t. Z (Diagonal
elements).

w.r.t. $\alpha_i$:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 E_z}{\partial \alpha_i^2} = \sum_{n=1}^N\sum_{k=1}^K \gamma_{nk} \left\{ -\delta_i^2p_{ki}(1-p_{ki})\mathbb{I}_{i \in D_n} \right\} - 1
$$

where$ \mathbb{I}_{i \in D_n} $takes value 1 if student $n$ attempted question
$i$ and 0 otherwise.



w.r.t. $\delta_i$:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 E_z}{\partial \alpha_i^2} = \sum_{n=1}^N\sum_{k=1}^K \gamma_{nk} \left\{ -(\theta_k-\alpha_i)^2p_{ki}(1-p_{ki})\mathbb{I}_{i \in D_n} \right\} - \frac{1}{4}
$$

where$ \mathbb{I}_{i \in D_n} $takes value 1 if student $n$ attempted question
$i$ and 0 otherwise.
